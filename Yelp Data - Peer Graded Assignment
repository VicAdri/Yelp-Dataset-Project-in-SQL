Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i.  Attribute table = 
   
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM attribute;
   
     Total Records: 10000

ii. Business table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM business;
	
	 Total Records: 10000

iii. Category table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM category;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000
	 

iv. Checkin table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM checkin;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000
	 

v. elite_years table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM elite_years;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000

vi. friend table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM friend;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000
	 

vii. hours table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM hours;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000

viii. photo table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM photo;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000

ix. review table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM review;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000

x. tip table =  

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM tip;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000

xi. user table = 

     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM user;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000
	 
	 


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =  
    
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS total_distinct_records FROM business;
   
     Total Records: 10000
   

ii. Hours =  

     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM hours;
	 
	 Total Records: 1562

iii. Category = 

     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM category;
	 
	 Total Records: 2643

iv. Attribute = 

     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM attribute;
	 
	 Total Records: 1115

v. Review =
     
	 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS total_distinct_records FROM review;
	 
	 Total Records: 10000

vi. Checkin = 

     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM checkin;
	 
	 Total Records: 493

vii. Photo =

     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM photo;
	 
	 Total Records: 6493 

viii. Tip = 

	 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT  business_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM tip;
     
     Total Records: 3979 
	 
ix. User = 

      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS total_distinct_records FROM user;
	  
	  Total Records: 10000

x. Friend = 

      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM friend;
	  
	  Total Records: 11
      
xi. Elite_years =

      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_distinct_records FROM elite_years;
	  
	  Total Records: 2780
	  


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 
	
	SELECT * FROM User 
	WHERE

	SELECT name, review_count
    FROM user
    ORDER BY review_count DESC
    LIMIT 3;
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

   No


  Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

  Running the query below and observing the results indicates that there is no correlation between the 
  number of reviews posted and number of fans. For example you can notice that Gerald has the most 
  reviews with 2000 reviews, but only 253 fans. On the other hand, Sara has 1629 reviews but with 
  only 50 fans. This suggests that there are other factors that contribute to a user's fan count, 
  such as the quality of the reviews,the frequency of the reviews, and the user's personality.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their 
   overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
   
   I chose city as 'Toronto' and Category as 'Restaurants'. The query returned six distint businesses. 3 of the results
    returned have 2-3 stars and the other 3 have 4-5 stars ratings.
   
   Code: SELECT b.name, b.stars, c.category
         FROM business b
         INNER JOIN category c
         ON b.id = c.business_id
         WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.stars IN(2,3,4,5)
         ORDER BY b.stars;
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

    Yes. We can observe that both groups have restaurants with specified operating hours for various days.

   (2-3) Code: SELECT b.name, b.stars, c.category , h.hours
               FROM business b
               INNER JOIN category c
               ON b.id = c.business_id
               INNER JOIN hours h
               ON b.id = h.business_id
               WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.stars IN(2,3)
               ORDER BY b.stars;
 
   (4-5) Code: SELECT b.name, b.stars, c.category , h.hours
               FROM business b
               INNER JOIN category c
               ON b.id = c.business_id
               LEFT JOIN hours h
               ON b.id = h.business_id
               WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.stars IN(4,5)
               ORDER BY b.stars;


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

    There is no clear correlation between the two groups since in group(2-3) the highest reviews is 47 and lowest is 5 
    and in group(4-5) the highest reviews is 89 and lowest is 8. 

               SELECT b.name, b.stars, c.category , b.review_count
               FROM business b
               INNER JOIN category c
               ON b.id = c.business_id
               WHERE b.city = 'Toronto' AND c.category = 'Restaurants' AND b.stars IN(2,3,4,5)
               ORDER BY b.stars;
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
     No.Given that all businesses are situated in 'Toronto,' it becomes challenging to pinpoint the precise geolocation
     of the restaurants. However, mapping the GPS coordinates would provide valuable insights and facilitate a more in-depth analysis.

SQL code used for analysis:

             SELECT b.name
        ,b.address
        ,b.city
        ,b.STATE
        ,b.latitude
        ,b.longitude
        ,b.stars
        ,b.review_count
        ,h.hours
        ,c.category
    FROM Business b
    INNER JOIN Category c ON b.id = c.business_id
    INNER JOIN Hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
    WHERE b.City = 'Toronto'
        AND c.Category = 'Restaurants'
    ORDER BY Stars DESC
        ,review_count DESC;

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
    Based on the data, the analysis shows that open businesses exhibit a higher average star rating of 3.679, 
    whereas closed businesses have a slightly lower average star rating of 3.520.      
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
     Open businesses have higher number of reviews by 25 compared to closed businesses which has 19.


SQL code used for analysis:

    SELECT is_open, avg(stars) as Avg_stars, review_count
    FROM business
    group by is_open;


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

   Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

   I have chosen to conduct sentiment analysis by parsing out keywords and business attributes.
   The goal is to analyze customer reviews and extract sentiment-related insights to understand the overall sentiment 
   towards businesses and their attributes.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

    To conduct sentiment analysis, I will need the review data which includes the review text, star ratings, and possibly 
    additional metadata such as the business ID, category, and user ID. This data will allow me to analyze the sentiment 
    expressed in the reviews and associate it with specific businesses. By considering the star ratings as well, I can 
    compare the sentiment expressed in the text with the overall rating given by the users.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

| -0-NjVqdOCyfIyKN_9yKlw | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night. When considering our options, we were sold when we saw the bacon board on the menu. It did not disappoint! It was an excellent and delicious start to our nice (giant) dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     4 | 2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw | Barbeque     |                   |

|                        | For our main course we had the BBQ sampler for two, as well as the shrimp and grits appetizer because I just couldn't help myself! The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       |                        |              |                   |

|                        | The sampler was very good, but not amazing. I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |                        |              |                   |

|                        | Since we brought up the missing turkey,  we were given a cobbler desert for free. That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |                        |              |                   |

|                        | Atmosphere is great - cozy, clean and modern. Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |       |                        |              |                   |

| -0Nwb-UiKiEb8eprBkqk-g | On a recent visit to Pgh I was happily surprised to find that numerous cupcake shops have sprung up since my last visit. Being the cupcake fanatic that I am, I tried Dozen, Coco's and Vanilla Pastry Studio. Although I think all three cupcake shops could have come up with better names, the VPS had the best products hands down. Over my 2 month visit, I tried their vanilla/vanilla, vanilla caramel, carrot, mocha and choc peanut butter. They were all incredible with the vanilla caramel being my favorite. And the atmosphere inside the shop is adorable, it made me want to skip around like I won the Willy Wonka golden ticket, and after tasting one of their cupcakes, into another world I went. |     5 | 20ib4z2Yo2wlfARFMcFwSQ | Food         | Shadyside         |
| -0viNoam1WRxW7BeclI9ug | If you have the chance to go to the West Side market - do it! Even if you aren't there to grocery shop there are plenty of made-to-order items. If you have time be sure to get a gyro from Steve's or a crepe from Crepes de Luxe. This place is truly unique! Even if you don't buy anything, it is a sight to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     5 | -Eu04UHRqmGGyvYRDY8-tg | Meat Shops   | Ohio City         |

|                        | Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |       |                        |              |                   |

It's a Blues Fest in Pittsburgh, not Dade Cunty Florida. Have you ever been to a Steeler game? You cheat all Buddy fans and Blues fans alike. Screw ever coming into your understaffed club again. Im sure Buddy can work around you and entertain Blues fans before this Legend is gone for good.

And admittedly, it is a bit crowded, and the washrooms are nasty, but that's true at most beaches I've visited in my life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       |                        |              |                   |

| -6aKBZYtdK7IQ7MJCAjkdA | This restaurant has the absolute best atmosphere. It starts from the moment you get out of your car and smell the aroma from the smokehouse.
